New shit made:

- Today I made a fucking sick property script that allows for the infinite properties that do not lag the server one bit. Basically it loads in the property on the client side when called so people that are in their homes wont lag others at all.

**County Side RP Development Project PGX:** *November 2019 - January 2020*
Huge Release / Update here I will be breaking it down into sections for an easier read! 

__**FrameWork**__
After the initial launch of the sever in November I realized that there were many issues with ESX and the way I wanted the server to run and feel when playing. In order to get over the hurdle of the ESX lock in I had to first develop a framework on witch the rest of the scripts could build on.
- created xBase and the PGX framework 
1) Started with creating a system to export my framework to other scripts and at the same time allowing room to expand ( moduels ) 
2) In order to do this I had to create a timeline of events that players do when connecting to the server ( initial connection, character selection, spawn location, and final start ) ( did not want features to be calling nil on players not loaded in ) 
3) After this I created a library of functions that would be used in most if not all later scripts 
4) Then came the hard part, Server side to data base then to client securely, in order to do this I had to basically remove most ESX functions from scripts so then I could use the data base with the new framework and not have ESX and PGX overlapping in calls 
5) Then came the fun part creating scripts and managers like xJobManager and xBase

List of new Framework managers
- Blip manager ( toggle blips ) 
- Job manager ( primary, secondary jobs with grades ) 
- Spawn Manager with integration 
- Client data Manager to manager and secure things like cuffing, death, and states ( allowing me to call this export to see if a player is cuffed from another script )
